<h1>Folder Structure:</h1>

<ol>
<li>
At the very root level of our project we have .gitigonre to manage what files should and shouldn't push on github, package.json file and some config files for the dependecies we are using, such as for typescript we are using, we can see tsconfig.json file for TS configuration, similarly we can see tailwind.config for tailwind and so on.
</li>
<li>
At the root of our project there is also a node module folder which have the dependecies files we are using in our project
</li>
<li>
To run our application we use command 'npm run dev' which starts our local dev server on localhost and it creates another folder at our root of the project which is '.next' folder, this folder contain our files for local server and manage build when we do so and it's generated by nextjs.
</li>
<li>
In our nextjs folder structure there is a src folder containing app folder which our main application, in src folder we can create our utiliy functions, components and so on, while in app folder we create our application which are basically routes in every nextjs application. Each route is a destination which could have a page to display or it could be an API route which could be an http request. 
</li>
<li>
Inside app folder we can see global.css which is our css file, page.tsx which is our '/' route and a layout.tsx which is a part of our nextjs application hierarchy which wrapes on our page.tsx,
</li>
